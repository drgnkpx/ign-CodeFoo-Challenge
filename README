This repository is for the ign CodeFoo Challenge. Each question is saved as a text file and the program is also saved as a java file. I have not learned enough programming to know how to graph the output of the program yet, I just finished the AP Programming course in Java this May.

For the final question I have included the pdf file of a game design document I created this year as my senior project at school. I worked with Clinton Lowe, the president of the Georgia Game Developers Association in making this project, but all of the concepts and work are completely my own. I believe my prurpose in life is to create games. No matter where or how I accomplish this, I will do so with all my heart, and I believe this project is proof of that as I worked over 100 hours during the school year to create it. IGN is the best gaming site I know and a job there would be more than I had hoped for starting out in the gaming industry at 18 without a college degree yet.
